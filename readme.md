# SE577 Technical Demos

SE577 is a graduate software architecture course.  Although the course focuses on software architecture there is a hands aspect that requires familiarity with some modern technologies.

This repo supports some of the technical demonstrations that will be conducted in this course.  Note some of the code in these repos is structured on purpose to demonstrate both good and bad software architecture decisions to support the learning objectives of this course.

Each demo will be rooted off of the main directory and have its own associated readme with important information
